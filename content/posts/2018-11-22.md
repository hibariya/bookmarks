## Dockerfile frontend experimental syntaxes

https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/experimental.md

You can build images with BuildKit on Docker 18.06 or later. With BuildKit, `RUN` instructions in Dockerfile accept `--mount` option. It can be used as a volume for build-time. For example, `RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt apt-get install ...` means "Mount /var/cache/apt as a cache directory while running the command". The cache remains in Docker host machine until you remove it with `docker builder prune`. In other words, you can share cache files among two or more build without writing them in the image.
