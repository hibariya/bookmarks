## Build Your Own Shell using Rust

https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/

A tutorial on building a shell using Rust. The tutorial starts with the simplest interactive CLI application that runs a command from the input. And then implement supporting multiple commands, handling arguments, implement well-known-built-in commands (such as `cd`), error handling and **pipes**. The tutorial does not deal with TTY (PTY) but it is a good starting point for people who are learning Rust or aspiring to develop a new shell.
