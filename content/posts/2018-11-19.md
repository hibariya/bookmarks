## Build Your Own Shell using Rust

https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/

A tutorial on building a shell using Rust. The tutorial starts with the simplest interactive CLI application that runs a command from the input. And then implement supporting multiple commands, handling arguments, implement well-known-built-in commands (such as `cd`), error handling and **pipes**. The tutorial does not deal with TTY (PTY) but it is a good starting point for people who are learning Rust or aspiring to develop a new shell.

Tools for building monorepo. This tool offers a tool to build a monorepo from multiple repositories preserving their git history. `monorepo_build.sh` imports multiple repositories into one repository by calling `rewrite_history_into.sh`. `rewrite_history_into.sh` imports a repository history changing all paths in git index with `git filter-branch`. Thanks to that, you can show the history of each file with `git log -p [path]` even after migration to the monorepo.
